Dear `mapbox-gl-shaders` contributors,

Thank you all for being such loyal supporters and champions of the `mapbox-gl-shaders` project. You helped write some amazing cross-platform GLSL. It has been an amazing ride, and we’re humbled by the opportunity to be part of something larger – something monolithic.

However — [due to various factors](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/3656)  — `mapbox-gl-shaders` is no longer able to operate as an independent git repository. We have made the tough decision to merge this repository into the [`mapbox-gl-js` repository](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js).

What you need to know:

 - All the code that used to live in this repository now lives in the [`mapbox-gl-js` repository in the `shaders` directory](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/tree/master/shaders).
 - The `mapbox-gl-shaders` repository is no longer accepting any issues or pull requests, these should all be directed towards the [`mapbox-gl-js` repository](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js).
 - [`mapbox-gl-js`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) and [`mapbox-gl-native`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native) will continue to work as before
 - This repository will be kept around indefinately for archival purposes.
 - This repository may be renamed in the future.

Yours,

The GL Team
